# redesAgua
This code is for simulate water behaviour in pipelines using Hardy Cross method. Also works for open networks. Ideal for developers who want to know their water flow and pressure in real time.

A good example is showed in Inicio.java class listed in main package. See resources to know how to upload data directly from txt or csv.

Check readMe file in resources before using your own data.

If you are unable to program, use the compiled version SimuladorRedesAgua.jar

Further changes are still being developed, like adding valves.
